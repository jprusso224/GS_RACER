function [passFailFlag] = waitForAcknowledgement(commandType)
% =========================================================================
% [passFailFlag] = waitForAcknowledgement(commandType)
%     This function should be called after a command is sent to the serial
%     port and poles the serial port for an acknowledgement from the MR.
%     Returns 1 when acknowledgement is received. Also has the capability
%     to return the CR and MR status strings for further processing within
%     the 'request_status_Callback(' function.
%
% Inputs: 
%   commandType - Character that was sent as the command identifier.
%
% Outputs:
%   passFailFlag - This is a boolean flag stating whether the command was
%                   successfully executed. (Acknowledgement received)
%
% UPDATE LOG ==============================================================
% Creation: 1/9/2015 by John Russo
% Update 1: 1/12/2015 by Thomas Green
%    - Added a case statement for different processing if it's a status
%    request. This will also need to be done for an image.
